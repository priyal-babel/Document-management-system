# Simple Ethereum + InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)+ React.jsÂ DApp

#A DApp that stores the IPFS hash of a document that is uploaded to IPFS on the Ethereum network. A transaction receipt will be issued to the user once the IPFS hash number has been transmitted to the Ethereum blockchain. To create a front-end, we'll use the Create-React-App framework. Any user who has MetaMask installed in their browser can use this Dapp.
